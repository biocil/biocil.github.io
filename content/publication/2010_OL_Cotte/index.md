abstract: We report the experimental observation of systematically occurring phase singularities in coherent imaging of sub-Rayleigh distanced objects. A theory that relates the observation to the sub-Rayleigh distance is presented and compared with experimental measurements. As a consequence, the limit of resolution with coherent illumination is extended by a factor of 1.64x.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
