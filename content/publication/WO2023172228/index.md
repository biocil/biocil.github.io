abstract: A photolithography method characterized by steps of providing a target phase, transmitting a beam from an EM radiation source (9) to a spatial light modulator (3) and the beam reflected from the spatial light modulator (3) to a sample (5), dividing a beam provided by a light source (10) into two as an object wave (7) and a reference wave (8) and transmitting the object wave (7) to the sample (5), merging and sending the object wave (7) went through the sample (5) and the reference wave (8) to an image receiving element (1) and obtaining a phase image, comparing the phase image and the target phase and the quantizing the phase image to create a new image for the spatial light modulator (3), if a difference between the phase image and the target phase is above a predetermined value.
