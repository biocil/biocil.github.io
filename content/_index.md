        ## Welcome to BiocIL

We are the **Biophotonics and Computational Imaging Laboratory (BiocIL)**, a multidisciplinary research group led by **Dr. Muhammed Fatih Toy** at **Istanbul Medipol University**. Our laboratory focuses on cutting-edge techniques such as **Quantitative Phase Imaging (QPI)**, **Digital Holography**, and **Fluorescence Microscopy** to explore the microscopic world of biological systems.

## Research Areas
Our main research areas include
- **Quantitative Phase Imaging (QPI)**: Label-free, high-resolution imaging of live cells.
- **Digital Holography**: Real-time 3D imaging of biological samples.
- **Fluorescence Microscopy**: Advanced molecular tracking using fluorescence techniques.

## Our Team
Meet our dedicated team of researchers and graduate students who drive innovation at BiocIL.
