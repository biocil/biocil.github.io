abstract: We present a novel spectrometer device offering a wide wavelength range and high resolution. The device builds upon a conventional prism spectrometer; however, an additional scattering medium is introduced to generate a wavelength-dependent speckle pattern on the detector array. Simultaneous use of the prism and the scattering medium allows for both improved resolution and wavelength range. The generated speckle pattern secures a significant improvement in the resolution (up to 100 folds) and dynamic range over a conventional prism spectrometer. With the proposed spectrometer, implemented using a CCD camera, we demonstrate up to 17-pm resolution at 855-nm central wavelength and 756.5-nm wavelength range revealing a dynamic range of ~44 500. The dynamic range could be further improved upon using a detector array having larger area and a scattering medium offering a narrower spectral correlation function. With further development, the proposed device could be useful in a variety of spectroscopy applications, such as deep imaging of retinal layers in optical coherence tomography.
