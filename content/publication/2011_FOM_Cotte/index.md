abstract: The deconvolution of complex fields is a new post-processing method for quantitative phase microscopy. Techniques like digital holographic microscopy (DHM) provide access to the complex wavefront. In particular, DHM holds the capability of imaging simultaneously amplitude and quantitative phase. We propose a method to improve the spatial resolution of such coherent microscopy systems by filtering of the coherent transfer function (CTF). The 3D complex deconvolution is presented and potential applications shown.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
