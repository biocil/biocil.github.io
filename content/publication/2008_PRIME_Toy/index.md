abstract: A novel thermo-mechanical infrared (IR) imaging array with integrated diffraction gratings for optical readout was fabricated and tested. Parylene was used as a structural material for its low thermal conductivity and high thermal expansion properties. Tests were performed using an IR blackbody target and first order diffracted light was imaged on a CCD camera to monitor the entire array. Results show that it is possible to achieve Lt100 mK NETD using a 12 bit CCD camera.
