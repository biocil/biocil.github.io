abstract: Optical microscopes are typically designed as versatile tools that are capable of imaging at various modalities with different resolutions in respective visual fields. A large extend of versatility causes increased complexity, size, and the cost. Imaging of tissue sections is a routine procedure in clinics and research laboratories. Tissue staining consumables, required time for staining along with the cost of the imaging systems are the limiting factors for widespread use. A multimode imaging system with enhanced resolution performance and automation is generally superfluous for the coarse resolution imaging of tissue sections. A dedicated system for label free tissue section imaging is presented. Label free imaging with high contrast is provided in form of quantitative phase. Earlier demonstrations of quantitative phase imaging of tissue sections utilized modified microscopes with different modalities for correlated imaging and motorized stages for field enlargement. Here, the system follows an off-axis digital holographic imaging configuration for the acquisition of quantitative phase at single shot. The system compromises from the resolution and magnification of a traditional microscope for the size of visual field, ease of use, and relative cost due to the exclusion of sample stages. A software level stitching further enlarges the effective field of view.
