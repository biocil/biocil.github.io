abstract: A top stage incubator is an essential equipment for long term imaging of live cells on a standard microscope. A low cost alternative to off-the-shelf top stage incubators is realized by using 3D printing technology. A closed system is designed for keeping the inner temperature at the desired value and an ITO coated glass plate is employed as a heater. The temperature inside the incubator is stabilized by using PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) algorithm that is controlled via Arduino Uno microcontroller. It takes approximately 20 minutes to stabilize the temperature at the desired value. The peak to peak temperature fluctuation after stabilization is ±1°C. Thus, the portable, user-friendly, easily accessible system allows long-term live cell imaging.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
