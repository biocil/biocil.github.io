abstract: We present an improved prism spectrometer with high wavelength range and spectral resolution. The device is an upgraded prism spectrometer that utilizes an additional scattering medium leading to a wavelength-dependent speckle pattern. We demonstrate <; 20 pm resolution and ~750 nm wavelength range with the proposed device. With the demonstrated spectral resolution, the speckle-enhanced prism could provide the means to image deep tissue layers in Optical Coherence Tomography.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
